Yes—here is a high‑level, end‑to‑end project documentation for a no‑Docker Twitter (X) Sentiment Analysis pipeline using Apache Spark, Hadoop, Python (NLTK), and Hive, grounded in official documentation and latest platform notes.[1][2]

### Project overview
Build a pipeline that ingests tweets from the X API v2 (or uses an offline public dataset for development), performs text normalization, computes lexicon‑based sentiment with NLTK VADER, optionally trains a supervised classifier with Spark ML, and persists curated results to Hive for SQL analysis and reporting.[2][3]

### Core architecture
- Ingestion: X API v2 endpoints (Recent search or Filtered stream depending on access tier) or an offline corpus for development and benchmarking.[4][2]
- Processing: PySpark jobs for cleaning, feature engineering, and sentiment computation using the DataFrame‑based Spark ML API, which is the primary, actively developed MLlib interface.[5][1]
- Storage and query: HDFS for data landing and Hive tables for structured access, with Spark configured to read/write Hive tables via enableHiveSupport.[6][7]

### Data sources
- Live data: Use X API v2; note that filtered streaming availability depends on access tier (Free/Basic do not support Filtered Stream, while Pro/Enterprise tiers offer streaming with rule management and reliability features), so plan your ingestion mode accordingly.[8][4]
- Offline data: For development without rate limits, use a well‑known public corpus such as Sentiment140, which contains labeled tweets for training and evaluation when API access is constrained.[9]

### Technology stack
- Compute and ML: Apache Spark with the DataFrame‑based MLlib for feature extraction (Tokenizer, TF‑IDF) and linear models (e.g., Logistic Regression) via pipelines and estimators.[5][1]
- Storage: Hadoop HDFS in single‑node mode for local development and file‑backed Hive tables (e.g., Parquet/ORC) managed by the Hive warehouse.[7][6]
- Python NLP: NLTK’s VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer providing neg/neu/pos and compound scores designed for social media text.[10][3]
- Interfaces: Spark SQL for analytics over Hive tables and Spark submit/shell for execution, with PySpark installed per official guidance when needed.[11][6]

### Environment setup (no Docker)
- Hadoop: Set up a single‑node/pseudo‑distributed cluster following the official guide, including configuring core‑site.xml/hdfs‑site.xml, formatting HDFS, and starting NameNode/DataNode for local development.[7]
- Spark: Install a current Spark build and use the standalone mode locally; MLlib’s primary API is DataFrame‑based, and PySpark can be installed via pip when appropriate for your workflow.[1][11]
- Hive: Install Hive from the official Apache Hive documentation and ensure Spark can access the Hive metastore and warehouse locations for table creation and queries.[12][6]

### Spark–Hive integration
- Create the SparkSession with enableHiveSupport so Spark connects to a persistent Hive metastore and supports Hive SerDes and UDFs, enabling saveAsTable/read.table patterns for managed or external tables.[13][6]
- When creating Hive‑format tables from Spark SQL, use the documented CREATE TABLE options for storage formats (e.g., ORC/Parquet), partitioning, bucketing, and table properties as needed.[14]

### Data model and storage
- Raw zone: Store raw JSON/CSV tweets (or offline dataset files) in HDFS paths that reflect landing date/topic for reproducibility and backfills.[7]
- Curated zone: Materialize cleaned and enriched tweet records with sentiment fields as Hive tables to support downstream Spark SQL analytics and BI queries at scale.[6]

### Processing pipeline
- Text normalization: Use Spark transformations to lowercase, remove URLs/mentions/hashtags, and tokenize prior to feature extraction or sentiment scoring with VADER.[5]
- Lexicon‑based sentiment: Apply NLTK VADER to compute neg/neu/pos and compound scores for each tweet; VADER is designed for social media sentiment and is lightweight for batch or streaming jobs.[3][10]
- Supervised learning (optional): Build a Spark ML pipeline with Tokenizer → TF/IDF → Logistic Regression (or another classifier) on labeled data to compare with VADER and quantify accuracy/F1 improvements in your domain.[1][5]

### Ingestion modes
- Batch pulls: Use X API v2 Recent search endpoints on a schedule to fetch topic/brand tweets within the recent window permitted by your access tier and store them as raw batches in HDFS for deterministic processing.[2]
- Streaming: If your tier includes filtered streaming, manage filter rules through the v2 rules endpoints and ingest tweets continuously with backfill/redundancy features available on higher tiers for reliability.[15][4]

### Model management
- Baseline: Use VADER as a baseline for fast coverage across topics and languages supported by its lexicon to deliver quick insights with minimal infrastructure.[3]
- ML pipeline: Train and persist DataFrame‑based Spark models and pipelines per MLlib guidance to ensure consistent inference, versioning, and reproducibility across runs.[1]

### Query and analytics
- Use Spark SQL over Hive tables to compute topic‑level rollups, sentiment distributions, and time‑series trends, leveraging Hive table metadata and file formats for efficient scans.[6]
- Create external tables mapped to curated HDFS directories when you want to manage data locations explicitly and separate lifecycle from the metastore object.[6]

### Security, access, and compliance
- Follow X Developer Platform policies for authentication, access tiers, and endpoint usage, and design your ingestion strategy around the documented capabilities and quotas for your plan.[4][2]
- Store only the fields required for analysis in Hive and consider pseudonymization where appropriate to align with data minimization best practices when handling user‑generated content.[2]

### Deliverables
- Reproducible environment instructions for Hadoop, Spark, Hive, and PySpark aligned with official docs to ease grading and portability.[11][7]
- Source code for ingestion (live or batch), PySpark processing jobs, VADER scoring, and optional Spark ML pipelines with evaluation notebooks and SQL reports.[10][1]
- Hive DDLs and data dictionary describing schemas, storage formats, and partitioning/bucketing strategy for curated tables.[14][6]

### Milestones
- Milestone 1: Stand up Hadoop single‑node, Spark standalone, Hive installation, and validate Spark ↔ Hive with enableHiveSupport and a test table round‑trip.[13][7]
- Milestone 2: Land a sample dataset (offline or small API pull), run normalization + VADER scoring in PySpark, and persist a curated Hive table with sentiment columns.[3][6]
- Milestone 3: Train and evaluate a Spark ML classifier on labeled data, compare against VADER, and publish summary metrics using Spark SQL queries over Hive tables.[5][1]
- Milestone 4: If access permits, wire up X API v2 Recent search or Filtered stream ingestion and operationalize batch/stream processing with the same enrichment/persistence flow.[4][2]
